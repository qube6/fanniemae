## Troubleshooting

If you're receiving dependency errors you may be running a newer version of node than what is supported. Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) . Once installed type "nvm install 0.12.0" and then "nvm use 0.12.0". If you are having trouble getting nvm installed, see this issue for help: [https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/576](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/576)
